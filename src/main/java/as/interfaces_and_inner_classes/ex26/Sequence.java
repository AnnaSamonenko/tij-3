/**
 * Modify Sequence.java by adding a method getRSelector( ) that produces a different implementation of the
 * Selector interface that moves backward through the sequence from the end to the beginning.
 * Create an interface U with three methods. Create a class A with a method that produces a reference
 * to a U by building an anonymous inner class. Create a second class B that contains an array of U.
 * B should have one method that accepts and stores a reference to a U in the array, a second method
 * that sets a reference in the array (specified by the method argument) to null, and a third method that
 * moves through the array and calls the methods in U. In main( ), create a group of A objects and a single B.
 * Fill the B with U references produced by the A objects. Use the B to call back into all the A objects. Remove some of the U references from the B.
